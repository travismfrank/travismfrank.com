        In <i>Emerald City</i>, I wrote: "The greatest moments of all / are those
        that makes us feel small". Every company and orchestra I found reveals
        that truth again and again. Sorrounding myself with dedicated,
        awe-inspiring people makes me feel small in the best way I can imagine.

          I co-founded <Link to="/music/records/sketching-the-sky">The Frank-Nilsson Contemporary Jazz Orchestra</Link> (CJO)
          with my good friend <a href="https://www.allanknilsson.com/" target="_blank">Allan Nilsson</a>.
          CJO was comprised of 18 instrumentalists and performed exclusively my and Allan's original works.

          I founded <Link to="/music/musicals">Black Tie Productions</Link>, a youth theatre
          company that produced original musicals written, directed, and performed entirely
          by high school students. I led the company as Executive Producer and Artistic Director
          for 3 years, across 5 original musicals, 8 productions, and 3.5k+ ticket sales.
          After stepping down, I continued to advise another year of productions and organize fundraising.
