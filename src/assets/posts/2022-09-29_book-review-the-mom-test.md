title: "Book Review: The Mom Test"
author: Travis Frank

The last few weeks, I've been making the rounds with my friends, mentors, and colleagues.  My life is fuller and happier because I'm finally [talking to people](https://www.travismfrank.com/writing/2022-09-22_talk-to-people), and I'm sharing my work and journey as an entrepreneur with people that matter to me.  One of the books that helped me get outside my comfort zone and start talking to people is *The Mom Test* by Rob Fitzpatrick.

Today, I'm going to share a short review of *The Mom Test* and tell you why it made such a big impact for me.

## The Review
*The Mom Test* is largely split into two sections: the first is about having productive conversations with customers, and the second is about how to find those customers and build a repeatable process for conversations.

The first section has several key ideas, including:
- Talk about their life instead of your idea
- Ask about specifics in the past
- Talk less and listen more
- Avoid compliments, hypotheticals, or ideas (bad data)
- Ask questions that have the potential to destroy your currently imagined business
- Keep it casual
- Every meeting either succeeds or fails, and commitment is success
- Pay close attention to emotional responses

Fitzpatrick writes terse, easy-to-understand prose.  This section is very easy to read, and unlike most "business books", the hits keep coming.  I often find business books to be a 4-page idea padded with 300 or so pages of examples.  *The Mom Test* dispenses with frivolous examples, and instead delivers insights at a thrilling pace.

I particularly enjoyed Fitzpatrick's one-line summaries at the end of each section.  These distillations are perfect as notes, and provide simple heuristics to guide your decision-making.

The second section of the book covers finding customers and building a process that allows you to share your learnings with your team.

I'm currently solo on [Ticket Bridge](https://ticketbridge.io), but even so the advice on cold-calling / cold-emailing (do it until you can chain warm intros) was invaluable.  Fitzpatrick provides advice on writing those first emails, defining your customer, and how to review after your conversations.  The chapter on note-taking was the least valuable part of the book for me, since I find note-taking to be very individual.

*The Mom Test* is an excellent read.  I wrote this review after my second reading, and I imagine there will be many more.

## How I changed my behavior
The most important test of every business book is to implement the core idea and see if it "works".  Over the past week, I've changed my behavior based on Fitzpatrick's advice, and I can already see results.

The most important change I made was to view customer conversations as "successes" or "failures", and define success as commitment of some sort: another meeting, an introduction, or a purchase.  With this framework, I was able to break down my inhibitions and do the most important thing every sales professional already knows how to do: ask!  If I ask for an intro or a followup meeting, I'm working towards success.  If I never ask, I can never expect to meet my goals.  This mental framework is incredibly powerful.

I should point out not every conversation I'm having is with a potential customer.  Many are my friends and mentors, and the main benefit of talking to them is fostering our relationship.  Even still, I ask if they can introduce me to someone.  This has already resulted in several key introductions I wouldn't have expected.

I also blatantly stole Fitzpatrick's cold email template.  It's really good.
