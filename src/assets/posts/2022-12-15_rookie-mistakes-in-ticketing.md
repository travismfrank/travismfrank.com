title: "Rookie Mistakes in Ticketing"
author: Travis Frank

I want to build something that makes the world a better place for people I care about.  That desire compelled me to start *Ticket Bridge*- now, it's one of the reasons I'm pivoting to build productivity software for theatrical production & stage managers.

## The Story So Far
If you're a first-time reader or need a refresher, *Ticket Bridge* was a company I founded in June of this year.  I was creating unscalpable concert tickets: tickets with tight secondary market controls to keep prices low and shift revenue from ticket scalpers to event promoters.

Three months ago, I launched *Ticket Bridge* and began reaching out to my network to find ticketing opportunities.  As I started the sales process, I jotted down a reflection in [Talk to People](https://www.travismfrank.com/writing/2022-09-22_talk-to-people).  At the time (as evidenced by my writing), I was already cognizant of my biggest entrepreneurial blunder: building before selling.  I course-corrected and spent the next 3 months talking to people, building connections in ticketing, and pitching *Ticket Bridge* to prospective customers.

That's it, you're all caught up!  So, why am I pivoting?

## Ticketing is Tough
The 6 months I spent on *Ticket Bridge* taught me enormous amounts about the ticketing industry.  I now have a much better idea of the challenges (and opportunities!) for blockchain ticketing:
- There are many, *many* competitors in this space, from established players like *Ticketmaster* and *Eventbrite* to startups like *[The Ticket Fairy](https://www.ticketfairy.com/)* and *[Ticketsauce](https://ticketsauce.com/)*.
- It's hard to improve on the product front; *Ticketmaster*'s product is rock-solid and loved by many ticketers I spoke with.
- The sales cycle for events is extremely challenging.  Many small promoters and artists aren't producing events frequently, meaning even if my pitch is outstanding, the payback period could be as much as a year.  The product also has to be top-of-mind many months later when the time comes to choose a ticketing platform, so my effort might ultimately be wasted if I can't stay on top of the account.
- *Ticket Bridge*'s primary competitive advantage, unscalpable tickets, is not a feature *any small promoter* seriously cares about.  This is something I knew when I started building, but it took the reality of pitching the product to my network to understand that meant I was building the wrong product for the market I have access to.

And the nail in the coffin:
- Margins are razor-thin.  With a "percentage of revenue" model, it would take serious scale to acquire material revenue.  Even if I charge a 10% service fee on every transaction, it would take $12k+ in monthly ticket sales just to pay myself minimum wage.  Unless I can convince large venues to switch (unlikely without first tackling smaller clients), that target is very difficult to reach in the time I have left before I need to generate income.

I'm still quite optimistic about blockchain ticketing.  The current system is absolutely broken; just look to the [recent events surrounding Taylor Swift's ticket sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/live-nation-ticketmaster-investigation-taylor-swift.html).  Unscalpable tickets are desperately needed at the highest levels of the live events industry.  There is incredible opportunity here, especially with blockchain infrastructure continuing to plummet in price ([the recent collapse of FTX](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto) is pushing the cost of developing on the blockchain even lower).

Unfortunately, I no longer believe I'm the right person to seize this opportunity.  My network is primarily in theatre, not concerts or festivals. Although I was able to leverage my Berklee contacts into several commitments, I lack the relationships required to bring the product to the right market (primarily stadiums and existing ticketing platforms like *Ticketmaster*).

If you helped me build *Ticket Bridge* - offered feedback, introduced me to someone, or committed to using the product - I sincerely thank you.  Your support and partnership mean the world to me.  I hope to return the favor in equal or stronger measure.

## The Upside
Though the outcome wasn't what I hoped for, *Ticket Bridge* was a valuable learning experience.  I learned and re-learned important lessons in entrepreneurship, business, and sales that I'm eager to apply:
- Every business starts with relationships.  With *Ticket Bridge*, I started by building a product and moved on to sales post-launch.  This was completely backward, and my biggest mistake.  See: [Talk to People](https://www.travismfrank.com/writing/2022-09-22_talk-to-people).
- The product must solve the customer's problem(s).  *Ticket Bridge* solved a problem, but it wasn't my customer's problem.
- I need a path to profitability that doesn't rely on unrealistic scale, years of work, or significant amounts of luck.
- Ideally, as a founder, I should have a competitive advantage in the market I'm serving.
- It's better to work together.  For the past 6 months I've been mostly working alone, which has taken its toll.  I'm used to collaborative work, from theatre to programming.

## Returning to my Roots
6 weeks ago, I was coming to these conclusions.  While I was still writing cold emails and meeting with promoters, I started brainstorming other options.  My mind immediately took me to productivity software for stage managers, an idea I'd briefly considered in January and discarded when ticketing captured my imagination.  I floated the idea by my friend Matt (a fellow theatre artist-turned-programmer), who reminded me he'd had the same idea a full year earlier.  He was supportive and full of ideas, and we decided to join forces to explore the prospect further.

Armed with the lessons I learned from *Ticket Bridge*, we started by reaching out to every SM we know.  The difference in tone between these conversations and those with promoters is stark.  Most folks we talk to are kind, excited to help, and forthcoming with problems we can solve.  To date, Matt and I have met with >20 PMs & SMs.  It took just a handful of conversations to realize we want to help the entire theatrical production team, not just SMs, so we broadened our scope to include PMs.

Returning to my roots is invigorating.  I spent most of my life in musical theatre rehearsal rooms; I know this culture and these people, and I'm excited to help solve these problems.

That's right- after a 3 year hiatus, I'm back in the theater biz!

## Fine
If you made it to the end of this rambling life update, you're someone I want to meet.  Please [get in touch](https://www.travismfrank.com/contact)!  I love meeting new people (and rekindling old connections).

I'll be back soon with a product announcement.  Time to get back to work.
