I'm 4 months into bootstrapping [Ticket Bridge](https://ticketbridge.io), and boy, is it a rollercoaster.  Here's my resting heart rate from the last year:

I left both [Place Exchange](https://www.placeexchange.com) and NYC in May, uprooting my life nearly entirely and bumping my heart rate in the process.  Over the summer it steadily climbed while the pressure mounted as I prepared for launch, peaking in August (launch was August 18th).  This month it's dipped as I've come down off the adrenaline of launch.  It felt remarkably similar to mounting a musical: build-up, excitement, and then post-show blues.

It's been nearly a month since launch, and I've had some time to reflect on the three months I spent building- and what I'm going to do differently moving forward.

## Talk to people
In short: **talk to people**.  For some, this is obvious advice.  Even for past-me, this is obvious advice.  I didn't build a [theatre company](https://www.travismfrank.com/about/leadership), record and release a [big band album](https://www.travismfrank.com/music/records/sketching-the-sky), or create [Deno's first GraphQL caching library](https://github.com/open-source-labs/obsidian) alone.  But for whatever reason, this time I decided to try building in isolation, and that (predictably) did not work out well.  I launched to no customers and built something I wasn't 100% sure anyone even wanted, all for the low price of **460+** hours!

Have you ever built a piece of IKEA furniture, only to realize in the final step that you used the wrong screw in step 2 and now you have to undo and redo all of your work to get the result you want?

Me too.

For Ticket Bridge, my "wrong screw" was not talking to customers.  As the months wore on, I knew in the back of my head that I needed to be doing this.  Talking to customers is startup canon.  But talking to customers would expose my ego, and that's scary!

I should be well-equipped to overcome this fear.  There's a popular quip in musical theatre writing circles: "kill your darlings".  Even though you may love your writing, don't be defensive.  Accepting criticism is an important part of every writer's journey.  You have to be open to "killing your darlings" to make room for new and better material.

Moving forward, I'm prioritizing talking.  Rather than intellectually divining a use for technology, I'm making the rounds with my friends and professional contacts to unearth what problems they're encountering every day.  If I discover everyone just wants a TODO app, I'll build that, even if it means abandoning what I've built so far.  I'm prepared to "kill my darlings".

I left my job to make something that makes the world a better place for artists, fans, and organizers; to give back to the community I come from.  The best way for me to achieve that goal is to talk to my community and learn where I can help.

## Start with the frontend
I'm fairly certain this isn't *always* true, but I made a critical error in building the backend first.  At Place Exchange, I mainly worked on the backend- it's comfortable for me.  When I started building Ticket Bridge, I was naturally attracted to building the backend first.

The trouble came when I realized that at launch, the frontend wouldn't utilize even *half* of what I built on the backend.  I likely wasted **100+** hours of development time building functionality that still hasn't seen the light of day (and may never).

The root cause: I wasn't talking to people!  Yes, it's just a symptom of the first lesson.  Without any input from customers, I busied myself building a system in the cloud that wasn't delivering any value to anyone.  If I had started with the frontend, I would have launched faster and started talking to customers faster.  The backend isn't necessary to get a commitment from a customer.

**Note** - This is true of Ticket Bridge, but I can imagine products where the backend matters *far* more than the frontend.  Your milage may vary.

## Fine
I'm just 50 contacts in, and I'm already feeling far better about my decision to start talking to people.  If you're excited to improve the music scene, [get in touch](https://www.travismfrank.com/contact)!  Let's make the world a better place together.
