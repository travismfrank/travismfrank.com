I’m thrilled to introduce [Prospero](https://prosperoapp.com): scheduling software for the stage.

One year ago, I announced I was embarking on a new project of building productivity software for folks in theater.  Today, I'm pleased to share that Prospero is live and helping theaters across the globe put up great shows - and we're just getting started.

## What is Prospero?
Prospero is scheduling & planning software for theatrical production teams.  It's designed to help you plan seasons and shows, communicate calendars with cast and crew, and serve as your scheduling hub.

At the core of the product is the **calendar**.  We know the calendar is where users spend the majority of their time in Prospero, so we took great care in designing a best-in-class user experience.  The calendar comes with all the layouts you'll need: month, week, day, and list.  Drag'n'drop functionality is baked in.  We designed every layout with pixel-perfect precision to make sure they're beautifully rendered on any screen size, especially mobile.

Once you have events on your calendar, the real fun begins.  Prospero lets you filter by almost any dimension to create customized calendars for any situation.  For example, if you want to put together a production calendar for your next production of *The Music Man*, you can filter by **Project > The Music Man** to see only events involved in the show.  If you want to share that calendar, you can save your filters as a **view**.  Each view comes with a shareable **view link**: an auto-updating, read-only version of your view.  You can distribute these to cast and crew, where they can then further filter the calendar to see just the events relevant to them.  As you change events in Prospero, your view links automatically stay up to date.

There's so much more to Prospero: from print & PDF functionality to our native Google & Outlook integrations.  The best part?  We improve the product every day, so it only gets better from here. :)

## People who need people
Building, launching, and growing Prospero is the experience I was searching for when I left my full-time gig at Place Exchange.  From those first conversations with Matt last winter, every step along the way has forced me to grow.

I have to stop at this point and acknowledge the incredible human that is Matt Meigs.  We had prior experience collaborating as programmers on [Obsidian](https://github.com/open-source-labs/obsidian), so this isn't our first rodeo, but the stakes are certainly much, much higher.  Matt blows me away every week with his ingenuity and tenacity.  I am lucky beyond words to have him as my business partner.

Partnering with Matt, re-joining the theatrical production community, and forming relationships with our initial customers has confirmed a core insight for me: people are at the center of everything.  Technology, art, philosophy - it's all pointless without other people to share and build with.  People who need people are indeed the luckiest of them all.

## Just like my country
This is still early days for Prospero.  We’re working day and night to hone the product and make our contribution to the industry.  And even though I’m working harder than I have in 6+ years, I feel more energized and motivated than ever.

Like any good startup, we're scrappy and hungry for customers.  While we're already live with a handful of theaters, 2024 is set to be our breakout year as I turn from full-time product development to sales and customer success.  We've built an exceptional product; it's time for us to properly bring it to market.

To set the tone, my theme this year is "traction", and to kick it off, I'm starting the new year in NYC with a series of meetings with our clients and prospects.  And if I'm not in a meeting with a client, you'll find me knocking on theater doors looking for production managers.  Technology may have changed, but cold calling hasn't.

If you read this far and you're interested in using Prospero on your next show, I'd love to chat.  We built Prospero for technology-inclined production folk like you.  Feel free to [get in touch](https://www.travismfrank.com/contact).

## Fine
The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed this is the first post on my personal site in over a year.  Expect a similar pace in 2024 (i.e., no promises on when I'll post next).  I'm choosing to spend my time and energy on Prospero and our customers.

I'm grateful and proud of everything the Prospero team accomplished in year one.  Here's to the next step on our journey.
